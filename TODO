- Add a text-search for bookmarks
- Allow sources to be enabled/disabled
- Add default tags per source
- Replace arrays with sets where possible
- Add a name to each source
- Deduplicate bookmarks (if more than one source has the same bookmark, it is added with duplicates)
- Is "postcss" still needed?
