- Deduplicate bookmarks (if more than one source has the same bookmark, it is added with duplicates)
- New Source Settings
    - Allow sources to be enabled/disabled
    - Add default tags per source
    - Add a name to each source
- Replace arrays with sets where possible
- Is "postcss" still needed?
